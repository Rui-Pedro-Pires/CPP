# C++ Projects: CPP00 to CPP04

This repository contains my journey through foundational C++ concepts, starting from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented programming principles. Through these projects, I explored topics like memory management, polymorphism, inheritance, operator overloading, and abstract interfaces. The exercises aim to strengthen C++ coding practices, focusing on clean, efficient, and scalable code. Each module introduces key learning aspects with practical exercises.

## Modules Overview

### CPP00 - Introduction to C++ Basics
This module covers namespaces, classes, member functions, and keywords like `static` and `const`. Key exercises include:
- **Megaphone**: A program that converts input text to uppercase.
- **My Awesome PhoneBook**: A basic phonebook application with functionalities to add, search, and display contacts.
- **The Job of Your Dreams**: Reconstructing a missing source file for an account management system using logs and headers.

### CPP01 - Memory Allocation & Pointers
Focuses on memory management, heap vs stack allocation, and pointers. Key exercises:
- **Zombie Class**: Understanding object lifecycles through stack and heap allocation.
- **Weapon Handling**: Differentiating between references and pointers in managing objects.
- **File Manipulation**: Writing a program to replace strings in files, highlighting memory and file handling.
- **Function Pointers**: Implementing a class (`Harl`) to call functions based on input levels without conditional logic.

### CPP02 - Ad-Hoc Polymorphism & Operator Overloading
This module introduces ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading, while reinforcing the Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF). Key exercises:
- **Fixed-Point Numbers**: Implementing a class to manage fixed-point numbers with operator overloading for comparisons and arithmetic.
- **Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)**: Creating a BSP algorithm to check whether a point lies within a triangle.

### CPP03 - Inheritance and Multi-Inheritance
This module dives deep into inheritance and multi-inheritance in C++. Key exercises:
- **ClapTrap**: A class representing a character with attributes like hit points, energy points, and attack damage.
- **ScavTrap & FragTrap**: Inheriting and extending functionality from ClapTrap with unique abilities.
- **DiamondTrap**: A multi-inheritance example with unique methods.

### CPP04 - Polymorphism, Abstract Classes & Interfaces
This module focuses on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. Key exercises:
- **Animal Classes**: Implementing polymorphic behavior in `Dog` and `Cat` classes derived from `Animal`.
- **Brain Class**: Managing memory and deep copying in animals through the `Brain` class.
- **Materia Interface**: Developing an inventory system with pure virtual functions and interface implementation.
